# Jogo da Adivinhacao JS
***
Game created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that involves guessing the secret number generated by the machine. I created an improved and better version of this game, which you can check out here --â†’ https://github.com/DanielTomazi/Numero-Secreto-Speak

However, if you want to test this older version, it is also available for testing: https://jogo-adivinhacao-js-hazel.vercel.app (Please note, this version is outdated and no longer maintained. I am providing the deploy just in case someone wants to explore the application and experience the original concept behind the game. For the correct experience, please access the new version I provided above).
